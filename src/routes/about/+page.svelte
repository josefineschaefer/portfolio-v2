		<p>
			After studying languages and communication, working in various odd side jobs, marketing
			agencies and start-ups, well, life happened. I lost my job, decided it was time for a change &
			entered a web development boot camp - and never looked back. My first job at a digital agency
			as a frontend engineer introduced me to Web Accessibility - a topic I still care about deeply
			and enthusiastically advocate for. It was during this time that I also re-discovered my
			passion for communication - I started writing, getting involved in employer branding and
			giving my first talk.
		</p>
		<p>
			This first talk at Codeland in 2021 was what ended up paving the way to my current job in
			Developer Relations at Storyblok. I love combining communication skills, the community aspect
			and being able to write as (one of the many) part(s) of my job. These days, Iâ€™m also a Girl
			Code Ambassador, advocating for more equality in the tech industry, and a Google Developer
			Expert in the field of Web Technologies. After work, I spend a lot of time upside down doing
			all sorts of circussy acrobatics, watching reruns of the Great British Bake off or teaching
			dance.
