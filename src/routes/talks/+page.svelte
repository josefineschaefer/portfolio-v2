			Accessibility is a decisive tool to make the internet a more inclusive place, it is absolutely
			crucial and despite the popular belief that only a small user group is affected, it benefits
			every single one of us. The reality doesn’t yet reflect that, though - accessibility often
			just seems like an afterthought. I will show the benefits of implementing accessibility and
			eliminate some of the prejudices. ​I want the audience to take away the fact that it's rather
			easy to get started, that a little bit is better than nothing and give them helpful tools to
			put their motivation into action.

			"Imposter Syndrome" is a buzzword in the tech industry; it seems to be ingrained in being a
			developer. Have we all just accepted this dreadful notion that we don’t really belong and will
			be found out in the long run? We need a more solution-oriented, inclusive approach to dealing
			with our insecurities. We need to collectively learn how to communicate and deal with them to
			make all our lives, but especially those who are just getting started in their careers,
			easier. That’s why I am sharing hands strategies on how to deal with imposter syndrome at
			work.

			Svelte has been described as an “accessibility-first-framework”, yet its compiler warnings
			cover only a fragment of the issues at hand. In this talk, I’d like to explore how accessible
			Svelte really is and more importantly, have a look at what you can do to bridge the gap. Ideas
			include checking both automatically and manually for issues the compiler might overlook, like
			color contrast, keyboard accessibility and semantics.

			You want to take your web development game to the next level? Be an outstanding asset to your
			team? Maybe even lead and mentor others? Instead of IDE shortcuts, productivity hacks and new
			shiny frameworks, let’s talk about allyship. As communities and teams, we must support each
			other to reach our common goal. Studies show that a wide range of different folks on a team
			will make the product or service better, improve code quality & make progress more
			sustainable. But one (big) step towards more diverse (and humane) teams is allyship - from the
			recruiting process to team culture & inclusive language. We’ll have a closer look at what it
			means to be an ally, why it’s crucial and what concrete steps you can take. It’s going to be a
			wild ride. It might hurt a little. But it’s going to make things better in the long run. From
			this talk, you will be able to take away concrete steps you can apply in your day-to-day life
			- making the tech community more inclusive, one step at a time.

			Developer Experience (DX) has become somewhat of a buzzword lately. But what is this trend
			really all about? Think about your experience with Svelte & Sveltekit. How things 'just work',

			practical ways to create your tools with the best possible DX by having a look at real-world
			examples and see what we can do to improve developer experience in the Svelte community and
